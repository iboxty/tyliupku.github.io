### Short Bio 
My name is **Tianyu Liu**. I am now a 4th-year Ph.D. student (expect to graduate in Jun 2021) in the Institute of Computational Linguistics (ICL, [website in Chinese](http://icl.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University. During my Ph.d. journey so far, I am very fortunate to work with Prof. [Zhifang Sui](https://icl.pku.edu.cn/cy/szf/ywb/index.htm) and Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1501/6756.htm) in Peking University, Dr. [Chin-Yew Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cyl/) and Dr. [Jin-Ge Yao](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Jin-Ge-Yao/145949061) in Microsft Research Asia, Prof. [Kevin Gimpel](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/) and Dr. [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/) in [TTIC](https://www.ttic.edu/), Dr. [Yizhe Zhang](https://dreasysnail.github.io/) (Microsoft Research) and Dr. [Yi Mao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/maoyi/) (Microsoft Business AI). My educational background and professional experiences can be found [here](/about).

My research interests include **natural language processing** (NLP) and **deep learning**. Specifically I focus on:
- Applications of large-scale transformer-based pretraining on natural language generation (NLG)
- Faithful and controllable neural text generation 
- Plan-based and template-like neural data-to-text generation
- Evaluation metrics on the faithfulness/fidelity/factualness of NLG
- Robustness, efficiency and interpretability in natural language inference
- Approximate inference for higher-order structure prediction

My publications can be found [here](/publications) or on the [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6hHbBwwAAAAJ) page.

**I am now on the industry job market, actively seeking for a NLP researcher or engineer position. Please drop me an email (A@B,A=tianyu0421,B=pku.edu.cn) or contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianyu-liu-28013a142/) if you want to chat.**
